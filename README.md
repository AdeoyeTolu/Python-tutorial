# INTRODUCTION TO PYTHON
WHAT IS PYTHON ?

Python is a high-level general-purposeprogramming language.Its design philosophy emphazizes code readability with
 the use of significant indentation.Python is dynamically typed and garbage-collected. It supports multiple program
ming paradigms, including structured,object oriented and functional programming
 


PURPOSE OF LEARNING PYTHON ?
Python is commonly used for developing websites and software,task automation,data analysis and data visualization.
 since it's relatively easy to learn, python has been adopted by many non-programmers such as accountants and scien
tists, for a variety of everyday tasks,like organizing finances.


Why Python?
Python works on different platforms (Windows, Mac, Linux, Raspberry Pi, etc).
Python has a simple syntax similar to the English language.
Python has syntax that allows developers to write programs with fewer lines than some other programming languages.
Python runs on an interpreter system, meaning that code can be executed as soon as it is written. This means that prototyping can be very quick.
Python can be treated in a procedural way, an object-oriented way or a functional way.


Good to know
The most recent major version of Python is Python 3, which we shall be using in this tutorial. However, Python 2, although not being updated with anything other than security updates, is still quite popular.
In this tutorial Python will be written in a text editor. It is possible to write Python in an Integrated Development Environment, such as Thonny, Pycharm, Netbeans or Eclipse which are particularly useful when managing larger collections of Python files.
Python Syntax compared to other programming language.


 Other programming languages often use curly-brackets for this purpose.Python Syntax compared to other programming languages
Python was designed for readability, and has some similarities to the English language with influence from mathematics.
Python uses new lines to complete a command, as opposed to other programming languages which often use semicolons or parentheses.
Python relies on indentation, using whitespace, to define scope; such as the scope of loops, functions and classes.



What is an IDE?
If a user wishes to perform a task using a computer, they use a program specially designed for that task. For example, a user who wants to analyze data may use spreadsheet software, such as Microsoft Excel or Google Sheets, two programs written specifically for that purpose. Similarly, software developers must use specialized programs to help them create programs. Over the years, this has included several types of applications, but now they have been consolidated into a single type of program known as an Integrated Development Environment (IDE). Every software has a creation cycle, and IDEs can govern each development phase. Developers can write, test, compile, and package their software using IDEs; they are vital to the operation of any modern software company and are used worldwide.

While specific IDEs may specialize in writing specific types of code (or are better suited for different languages), they can write all kinds of programs. These programs include the aforementioned applications, drivers, and utilities and are used by professionals, students, and hobbyists alike. The point is that IDEs are very versatile regarding when, why, and by whom they are used. ,

Examples of IDEs include NetBeans, Eclipse, IntelliJ,  Visual Studio and jupyter notebook. i used jupyternote book.
Jupyter Notebook: The Classic Notebook Interface
The Jupyter Notebook is the original web application for creating and sharing computational documents. It offers a simple, streamlined, document-centric experience.
